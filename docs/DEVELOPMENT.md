## Running tasks

We use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for common development tasks. Run following command to list available tasks:

```bash
task --list
```

## Running Rancher Dashboard with UI Extension locally

```

See [Rancher UI Extensions documentation](https://extensions.rancher.io/) for more info.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Allowed commit types are defined in [`.commitlintrc.yaml`](../.commitlintrc.yaml).

You can lint commits in relation to the `main` branch using `task lint:commits`.
